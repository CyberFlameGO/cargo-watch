Cargo Watch watches over your project's source for changes, and runs Cargo
commands when they occur.

If you've used [nodemon], [guard], or [entr], it will probably feel familiar.

```
$ cargo install cargo-watch
```

With [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/ryankurte/cargo-binstall):

```
$ cargo binstall cargo-watch
```

Or clone and build with `$ cargo build` then place in your $PATH.

This repository contains a [manual page](./cargo-watch.1) and
[Zsh completions](./completions) that you may want to install.

## Usage

By default, it runs `check`. You can easily override this, though:

```
$ cargo watch [-x command]...
```

A few examples:

```
# Run tests only
$ cargo watch -x test

# Run check then tests
$ cargo watch -x check -x test

# Run run with arguments
$ cargo watch -x 'run -- --some-arg'

# Run an arbitrary command
$ cargo watch -- echo Hello world

# Run with features passed to cargo
$ cargo watch --features "foo,bar"
```

There's a lot more you can do! Check out:
